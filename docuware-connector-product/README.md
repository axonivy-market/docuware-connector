# DocuWare Connector

[DocuWare](https://start.docuware.com/) offers cloud-based document management and workflow automation software. It can be used to digitize, archive and process any business documents in an audit-proof manner to optimize your company's core processes.

The Axon Ivy DocuWare connector enables efficient integration of DocuWare functionalities into your Axon Ivy process applications

This connector:

- minimizes your integration effort: use the demo version, which contains examples of the API calls.
- is based on REST web service technologies.
- gives you access to basic DocuWare functions.

## Demo

### Features

1. **Organization Retrieval**  
   Click the **Organizations** button to retrieve the organization ID. The system will automatically include this ID in subsequent requests.

2. **File Cabinets Retrieval**  
    Click the **File Cabinets** button to fetch the cabinet Id of the selected organization. The cabinet Id determines where the file will be uploaded.

4. **Document Retrieval**  
   Automatically fetch documents using the predefined **organization** and **fileCabinetId** fields from the `variables.yaml` file.

   You also can change the **organization** and **fileCabinet** by changing the **Filter**. It supports multi-selection for both fields.

To view and edit documents and their properties, run the process named **DocuWare View/Edit Document**.

To upload documents and perform actions like retrieving organizations, getting file cabinets, and uploading documents, run the process named **Start some DocuWare calls**.

## Setup

Before any interactions between the Axon Ivy Engine and DocuWare services can be run, they have to be introducted to each other. This can be done as follows:

1. Get a DocuWare account and the DocuWare cloud `host`, `user-name`, and `password` to use.

2. Override the global variables for `host`, `username`, and `password` in the demo project as shown in the example below.

```
@variables.yaml@
```

3. DocuWare supports 3 ways to generate an Access Token from the Identity Service:

    3.a Request Token by Username & Password - GrantType is `password`
    
    3.b Request Token by a DocuWare Token - GrantType is `dwtoken`
    
    3.c Request Token by Username & Password (Trusted User) - GrantType is `trusted`

4. For GrantType is `dwtoken`, we must get a LoginToken. Please start the process startRequestALoginToken.ivp and follow the guide to generate a new LoginToken

If your REST URL does not follow the predefined REST URL pattern of this connector, you can change the URL in the Engine Cockpit. To change the URL in the Designer, you have to unpack the connector project and change it there.

Run `start.ivp` of the DocuWareDemo demo process to test your setup.
