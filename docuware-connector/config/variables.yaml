# == Variables ==
# 
# You can define here your project Variables.
# If you want to define/override a Variable for a specific Environment, 
# add an additional ‘variables.yaml’ file in a subdirectory in the ‘Config’ folder: 
# '<project>/Config/_<environment>/variables.yaml
#
Variables:

    # The Logon URL will be automatically determined.
    # If this variable is set (not-empty), this URL
    # will be taken as the Logon URL. It typically looks like
    # https://.../Acount/Logon
    # Only set this value, if the automatic determination does not work.
