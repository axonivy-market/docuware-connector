# == Variables ==
# 
# You can define here your project Variables.
# If you want to define/override a Variable for a specific Environment, 
# add an additional ‘variables.yaml’ file in a subdirectory in the ‘Config’ folder: 
# '<project>/Config/_<environment>/variables.yaml
#
Variables:
  # DocuWare user name
  docuware.username: USER
  
  # DocuWare password
  # [password]
  docuware.password: PASS
  
  # DocuWare host id

  # The Logon URL will be automatically determined. If this fails, override the
  # automatic determination and set the full URL here.
  # It typically looks like https://.../Acount/Logon
  # If you want to keep the automatic, set this variable to AUTO
  docuware.logonurl: AUTO
